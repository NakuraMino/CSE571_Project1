# GPNet2 

My first successful neural network to predict delta states using augmented states as input. It is heavily overfitted, but is used in the cartpole_overfitting.mp4 as the main cartpole, and as the ghost cartpole in cartpole_standardize.mp4

# GPNet3 

My second successful neural network that doesn't rely on overfitting as much. Instead, this neural network relies on standardizing the data, and is trained for less iterations. The output can be seen as the main (dark) cartpole in cartpole_standardize.mp4
