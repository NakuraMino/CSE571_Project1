# CSE571_Project1

Use the same conda environment as Homework 1, and also install pandas. 

src/ contains the CNN used to predict the delta states of the cartpole. In the src directory, run
```
python cartpole_preds_with_nn.py
```
to recreate videos. 

model/ contains the architectures of the CNNs.

GPNet/ is the practice neural network that was used to predict delta states given augmented states. 

figures/ contains images used in presentation and the final report

results/ shows videos of all four neural networks.
