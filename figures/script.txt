while working on our project, we realized several limitations to our neural networks 

First, we cannot make predictions at the beginning of an epoch or at the end because our neural network requires a sequence of before and after images 

Second, due to how the test data is structured, our network cannot make predictions on it's previous predictions, unlike gaussian processes.
This is because we take in an "after" image as input as well. 

 Third, we see our network performing poorly when the cartpole is at a standstill. As can be seen in the graph, the acceleration oscillates a lot, 
but our network does not capture this well. This is either because a sequence of standstill images do not provide enough information, or because 
the network sees less training data for the swing up policy.

Finally, we see that more images provide better predictions, especially in the second derivative graphs. 

Through this project, we gained first hand experience on deep learning. We learned about the intricacies of how to create a dataset and transform it into 
data to feed into the neural networks, and we also learned about the different hyperparameter choices we can make for the neural networks.

We would also like to thank the course staff and the online forums, as well as several other resources we used to figure out our project.
